### Data Flow

1. User interacts with frontend interface (search, dashboard, strategy builder)
2. Frontend sends requests to Flask backend routes
3. Backend routes process requests and delegate to appropriate services
4. Services interact with external APIs (yfinance, Groq) and the database
5. Data is processed, analyzed, and formatted for presentation
6. Results are returned to the frontend for display
7. Background processes handle periodic updates (watchlist prices, market indices)

## Implementation Details

### Flask Application (app.py)

The main application is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. Key implementation details include:

- **Route Handling**: Defined routes for all pages including dashboard, stock search, and strategy builder
- **Authentication**: Implemented using Flask-Login with secure password hashing
- **Session Management**: User sessions with secure cookies and proper validation
- **Form Processing**: Validation and processing of form inputs for stock searches, strategy parameters, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **API Endpoints**: Internal API routes for AJAX requests and data updates

```python
# Key routes in app.py (simplified example)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    """Render the landing page"""
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/dashboard')
@login_required
def dashboard():
    """Render the user dashboard with portfolio and watchlist"""
    # Get user's watchlist from database
    conn = get_db_connection()
    watchlist = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM watchlist WHERE user_id = ?', 
                            (current_user.id,)).fetchall()
    
    # Get real-time prices for watchlist
    watchlist_data = get_watchlist_prices(watchlist)
    
    # Get portfolio data
    portfolio = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM portfolio WHERE user_id = ?',
                            (current_user.id,)).fetchall()
    portfolio_data = get_portfolio_data(portfolio)
    
    # Get market indices
    indices = get_market_indices()
    
    # Get recent news
    market_news = get_market_news()
    
    return render_template('dashboard.html', 
                          watchlist=watchlist_data,
                          portfolio=portfolio_data,
                          indices=indices,
                          news=market_news)
```

### Database Implementation

StockSense uses SQLite for database operations, with a schema defined in `schema.sql`:

- **users**: Stores user authentication information
- **watchlist**: Records stocks users are monitoring
- **portfolio**: Tracks user stock holdings with purchase information
- **strategies**: Saves user-created trading strategies

The database is initialized using the `init_db.py` script, which creates tables and populates sample data:

```python
# Sample database initialization (simplified)
def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('StockSense.db')
    
    # Create tables from schema
    with open('schema.sql') as f:
        conn.executescript(f.read())
    
    # Add sample user with hashed password
    password_hash = generate_password_hash('password123')
    conn.execute('INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
                ('Demo User', 'demo@example.com', password_hash))
    
    # Add sample watchlist and portfolio items
    sample_stocks = [
        (1, 'AAPL', 'Apple Inc.'),
        (1, 'MSFT', 'Microsoft Corporation'),
        (1, 'GOOGL', 'Alphabet Inc.'),
        (1, 'RELIANCE.NS', 'Reliance Industries Limited')
    ]
    
    conn.executemany('INSERT INTO watchlist (user_id, symbol, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', 
                    sample_stocks)
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

### Service Layer

The service layer contains modular components handling specific business logic:

1. **stock_service.py**: Handles stock data retrieval and processing
   - Fetches real-time and historical data from yfinance
   - Calculates technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD)
   - Processes and formats data for frontend visualization

2. **ai_service.py**: Manages AI model integration
   - Connects to Groq API (LLaMA/Mixtral models)
   - Creates custom prompts for stock analysis
   - Processes AI responses for display

3. **strategy_service.py**: Implements strategy backtesting
   - Defines trading strategy logic
   - Tests strategies against historical data
   - Calculates performance metrics

4. **scraper_service.py**: Handles web scraping
   - Extracts news articles using Playwright
   - Analyzes sentiment of news content
   - Caches results to minimize redundant scraping

Example of AI service implementation:

```python
# Simplified example from ai_service.py
def analyze_stock_movement(symbol, stock_data, news, timeframe='medium'):
    """Generate AI analysis of stock movement and prospects"""
    try:
        # Initialize Groq client
        client = groq.Client(api_key=os.environ.get('GROQ_API_KEY'))
        
        # Prepare stock data summary
        recent_prices = stock_data['Close'].tail(10).to_dict()
        price_change = stock_data['Close'].pct_change(20).iloc[-1] * 100
        
        # Create news summary
        news_summary = "\n".join([f"- {item['title']}" for item in news[:5]])
        
        # Build prompt for AI
        prompt = f"""
        I need an analysis of {symbol} stock:
        
        Recent price data:
        {recent_prices}
        
        Price change (20 days): {price_change:.2f}%
        
        Recent news:
        {news_summary}
        
        Please provide:
        1. A technical analysis of recent price movements
        2. Key factors affecting the stock currently
        3. Short-term outlook ({timeframe} term)
        4. Potential risks and opportunities
        """
        
        # Get response from model
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama3-70b-8192",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled financial analyst with expertise in stock market analysis."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            max_tokens=1000,
            temperature=0.3
        )
        
        # Return formatted analysis
        return {
            'success': True,
            'analysis': completion.choices[0].message.content
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors gracefully
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e),
            'analysis': "We couldn't generate an analysis at this time. Please try again later."
        }
```

    const ctx = document.getElementById(canvasId).getContext('2d');
    
    // Prepare data
    const labels = stockData.dates;
    const prices = stockData.prices;
    const volumes = stockData.volumes;
    
    // Create chart
    const stockChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'line',
        data: {
            labels: labels,
            datasets: [{

            }]
        },
        options: {
            responsive: true,
            interaction: {
                mode: 'index',
                intersect: false,
            },
            scales: {
                y: {
                    type: 'linear',
                    display: true,
                    position: 'left',
                },
                y1: {
                    type: 'linear',
                    display: true,
                    position: 'right',
                    grid: {
                        drawOnChartArea: false,
                    },
                }

    if chat_history is None:
        chat_history = []
    
    try:
        # Initialize Groq client
        client = groq.Client(api_key=os.environ.get('GROQ_API_KEY'))
        
        # Prepare messages including chat history for context
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are StockSense, an AI assistant specializing in stock market analysis and investment advice. Provide helpful, accurate information about stocks, market trends, and investment strategies. When discussing specific stocks, focus on factual information and balanced analysis."}
        ]
        
        # Add chat history for context
        for msg in chat_history[-5:]:  # Limit to last 5 messages for context
            messages.append({"role": msg['role'], "content": msg['content']})
        
        # Add current user message
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
        
        # Get response from model
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="mixtral-8x7b-32768",  # Using Mixtral model for chatbot
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=1024,
            temperature=0.7  # Higher temperature for more conversational responses
        )
        
        # Extract and return the response
        ai_response = completion.choices[0].message.content
        
        # Update chat history
        chat_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
        chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": ai_response})
        
        return {
            'success': True,
            'response': ai_response,
            'chat_history': chat_history
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e),
            'response': "I'm having trouble connecting right now. Please try again later."
        }
```

## Data Extraction Methodology

### Stock Data Retrieval

StockSense uses multiple approaches to gather comprehensive stock data:

1. **yfinance API**:
   - Primary source for historical price data and real-time quotes
   - Provides fundamental data (market cap, P/E ratio, dividends)
   - Offers global market coverage including US and Indian stocks
   - Handles high-frequency polling for watchlist updates

2. **Web Scraping**:
   - Extracts news articles from financial websites
   - Gathers additional data not available through yfinance
   - Implemented using Playwright for browser automation
   - Includes intelligent retry mechanisms and error handling

### Challenges in Data Extraction

Several challenges were addressed in the data extraction process:

1. **Rate Limiting**: yfinance and news websites impose request limits
2. **Data Consistency**: Different sources may provide conflicting information
3. **Dynamic Content**: Financial news sites use JavaScript-heavy interfaces
4. **Market Hours**: Different operating hours for US and Indian markets
5. **Error Handling**: Network issues and temporary API outages

### Solutions Implemented

To address these challenges, the following solutions were implemented:

1. **Caching Layer**: Implemented efficient caching to reduce API calls
2. **Data Normalization**: Standardized data from different sources
3. **Headless Browser Automation**: Used Playwright for complex sites
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Parallelized data retrieval where possible
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative data sources when primary sources fail

Example of real-time data extraction:

```python
# Simplified example of web scraping for news
def get_market_news(symbol=None, limit=10):
    """Extract market news using Playwright"""
    cache_key = f"news_{symbol}_{limit}" if symbol else f"news_general_{limit}"
    cached_news = get_from_cache(cache_key)
    
    if cached_news:
        return cached_news
    
    try:
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
            page = browser.new_page()
            
            # Construct URL based on whether we want general news or stock-specific news
            url = "https://finance.example.com/market-news"
            if symbol:
                url = f"https://finance.example.com/quote/{symbol}/news"
                
            page.goto(url)
            
            # Wait for news container to load
            page.wait_for_selector(".news-container")
            
            # Extract news articles
            news_elements = page.query_selector_all(".news-item")
            news = []
            
            for elem in news_elements[:limit]:
                title_elem = elem.query_selector(".news-title")
                source_elem = elem.query_selector(".news-source")
                time_elem = elem.query_selector(".news-time")
                link_elem = elem.query_selector("a")
                
                if title_elem and link_elem:
                    news.append({
                        "title": title_elem.inner_text(),
                        "source": source_elem.inner_text() if source_elem else "Unknown",
                        "time": time_elem.inner_text() if time_elem else "",
                        "url": link_elem.get_attribute("href"),
                        "sentiment": analyze_sentiment(title_elem.inner_text())
                    })
